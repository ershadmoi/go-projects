# This is a sample configuration entry that works off of localhost
# The configuration-reader follows a standard paradigm.
# Anything starting with a "#<space>"is a comment and it is ignored

# Anything starting with an "@" is a node info entry
# e.g. "@ <NodeNum> <HostName> <PortNum>
@ 0 localhost 8000
@ 1 localhost 8001
@ 2 localhost 8002
@ 3 localhost 8004
@ 4 localhost 8005

# Anything starting with an "!" is a connection information entry
# e.g. "! <SourceNodeNum>  <DestNodeNum1> <DestNodeNum2> ....
